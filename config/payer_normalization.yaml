# Payer normalization for RAG filtering and state.
# canonical: token used in the RAG index (document_payer). Must match published_rag_metadata.
# aliases: user-facing names, abbreviations, parent/subsidiary names that map to this payer.
# Update this file when adding payers or normalizing new names; no code changes required.
#
# To extend: run a normalization query (e.g. against your data source) to list parent/subsidiary
# names and add them under aliases for the appropriate canonical payer.
